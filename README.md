# Ripple-button-and-Custom-scrollbar-library (development)
This library is all about beautiful buttons and non-space consuming scrollbars...

## Scroll-bar
As a developer, we all hate the old-school, ugly-looking space consuming scrollbar. So as a solution to that I've created a something really simple, a non-space consuming scrollbar. In the future of this library I'll add more flexibility to customize the look and feel, appearance and much more. Right now the scroll-bar just indicated the percent we've scrolled in the page, when it is a production library, it will scroll as a normal and will have further customization.

## Ripple-Button
The most interesting part of the library. This is fairly simple, we all use WhatsApp these days and we click on the chats every single minute... There we see an interesting effect called 'ripple effect'. This feature is still in development and will have more flexibility to customize the look and feel, appearance and much more. There are some `data-` attributes in use and will be more at the end... 

### If you wish to help me completing this simple project, its all welcome...   :)
#### If there are no `data-` attributes in use at last, we'll be implementing variable initialization which will then have the customization properties.

###### That's all for now, this repository will get updates whenever I add more features... Thanks for coming, stay tuned for the production build update...
